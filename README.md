Final project for Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program. Implement a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.

### Project files includes:
* route_planner.py - the route planner function
* project_notebook.ipynb - Jupyter notebook project with instructions
* map-10.pickle - a map with 10 intersections
* map-40.pickle - a map with 40 intersections
* helpers.py - helper functions
* test.py - test functions
